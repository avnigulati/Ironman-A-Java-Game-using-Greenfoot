### Week 2 (ending 09/30/2017):

In the second week, we researched on the various options available in greenfoot and finalized the following:

1. The game layout
2. The various enemies/random objects that the *Hero* of the game will be playing against.
3. The number of levels in the game

I researched on the possibility of integrating a greenfoot with a motion sensor like Kinect, so that we could make the finished game playable using one if we have time left before deadline.

I am looking into the various actions that can be performed by the *Hero* of the game and have also, started reading on the various design patterns that the *Hero* and his related actions will fit into.

#### XP core value Simplicity

We are making sure that simple ideas are being implemented while making the design pattern for the various modules in the game. The different design patterns to be implemented are being distributed across the team keeping the complexity low. Keeping the time constraint we are ensuring that only the required features are being included and implemented.

### Week 1 (ending 09/23/2017):

In this week, I researched on the possibilities of deployment of a greenfoot game on a web server.

#### XP core value Simplicity

I and my teammates are discussing the project goal for building the game. We are yet to decide on the game and will most likely finalize one next week. We plan to progress towards the goal with simple steps defining small term goals which will consolidate and contribute to the final output. For our game we plan to construct a basic structure and choose the most applicable design for each action which is going to be performed.
