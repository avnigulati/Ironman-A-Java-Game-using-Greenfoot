# Week 2

In the second week, our team researched on possibilities of games in Greenfoot and by mid of the week we decided a layout of the game. I researched into how destruction elements in Level 1 of the game will appear randomly on screen for player to kill them and killing the destruction elements will gain points for the player. Also, I looked into how the health of the player decreases when it gets hit by one of these elements.

## XP core value Feedback

On Saturday my team and I decided to research on game options in Greenfoot. Around mid of the week, we discussed and took feedback from each member as to what they researched and which type of game in Greenfoot is more appropriate for the project. Taking constant feedback from every member helps our team to improve and expedite learning from our past week's experiences.

# Week 1

In the first week I researched on unity web gaming engine and tried of a simple 2D UFO Game from the unity official 
tutorials. I understood the principles of working with game objects and components.

## XP core value Feedback
My team and I worked throughout the first week exploring different gaming engines and trying out sample games. We followed
short feedback-loop during the week by taking feedback from team members researching on similar gaming engines. This helped 
the pairs researching on the same gaming platform to quickly understand its working and scope. Also, we took feedback from 
each member on the technology stack they worked on during the week. We came to a conclusion that Greenfoot engine suits our 
requirement for game development.
