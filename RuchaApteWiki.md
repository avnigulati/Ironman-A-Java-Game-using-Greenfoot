Week 1 (9/23/2017): I have started my research on games using melonJs game Engine and thinking of ideas for the game. I implemented the platformer game and designed the pokemon old style game both on melonJs. Links used for this are as below: http://melonjs.github.io/tutorial-platformer/ https://github.com/pokettomonstaa/newbark

My core value is Build Integrity In. The team adopted the value by keeping a balance between what and how many tasks they had in hand. This made sure that each member did a flawless research. We had a meeting on day 1 and another one mid week which made sure that there was a proper flow of information ,thus keeping the integrity intact.
