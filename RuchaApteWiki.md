Week 4 (10/21/2017)
1. I have created the class diagram for the Menu(main screen) for the game.
2. Team took ownership for creating class diagrams for one pattern each thus implementing Build Integrity In value. 


Week 3 (10/7/2017)

I finalized the classes and its functions that would be used for Menu,Level 1 and Level 2.
The command pattern fits well for the Menu GUI where there would be 2 buttons-Play and Help.

Team complied to Build integrity in by choosing small items to be researched on and finishing it without flaws.


Week 2 (9/30/2017)

1. I researched about the layout of the background in the game. 
2. The game would have a main menu, Level 1 and Level 2.
3. I finalized the background images for all three.
4. Also, I wrote the code to enable the background to be scrolling to make the player appear to be moving forward.The code is attached in the issue that was created for the activity.

Team showed the value Build integrity in by placing themselves in place of the other members and treating them the way they would want to be treated.This enabled the team members to have healthy discussions and made sure that disturbances remain at bay while working.

Week 1 (9/23/2017): I have started my research on games using melonJs game Engine and thinking of ideas for the game. I implemented the platformer game and designed the pokemon old style game both on melonJs. Links used for this are as below: http://melonjs.github.io/tutorial-platformer/ https://github.com/pokettomonstaa/newbark

My core value is Build Integrity In. The team adopted the value by keeping a balance between what and how many tasks they had in hand. This made sure that each member did a flawless research. We had a meeting on day 1 and another one mid week which made sure that there was a proper flow of information ,thus keeping the integrity intact.
