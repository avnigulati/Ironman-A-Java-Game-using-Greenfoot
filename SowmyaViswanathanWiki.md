Week#2

We had a stand up meeting mid of the week to discuss on the team's progress. Ideas presented by each team member was taken into consideration and accordingly the tasks were assigned to every person. Communication was an important factor this week as that has helped the team finalize on the game requirements.

Week#1

CATCH THE FLIES!!

To understand the working of Greenfoot application, I designed and implemented a simple game - Catch the flies. It has a Snake which can be moved on the game board using the arrow keys in the keyboard to catch the flies which will be randomly moving in the board. There is a score card in the game, to keep a track of number of flies the snake catches.

The game is designed to have two main classes : World and Actor. World has subclasses : MyWorld and weave. Actor has subclasses: flies, snake and scoreboard.

Game's code is attached in Issue# 6.
