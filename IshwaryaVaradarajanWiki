* The game is designed to have a sphere object or a ball which is moved in a particular direction by applying force to it using the arrow keys of the keyboard. 
* This game is designed to understand game development using Unity3d and to compare the development experience with other game engines such as python's PyGame.

Below are the instances that indicate, that the team adopted the 'Eliminate Waste' which is one of the lean core values:
Week1 (09/16/2017)
1) A meeting between the team members was held to assign tasks to work on for the week, hence eliminating waiting of team members to start working on their respective tasks
2) Members are assigned the number of tasks in such a way that, over committing to tasks is avoided
Week2 (9/30/2017)
1) Game components were categorized and divided among team members to design and define the features, so that redundant work was avoided
